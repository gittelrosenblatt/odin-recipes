# Odin Recipes Project
This is my first project from *The Odin Project* curriculum. This project will be a simple website featuring links to various recipes. 

## How It's Made:
This project uses basic HTML and will eventually use CSS. 

## Skills Demonstrated:
By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my skills in using HTML to make simple websites.

## Lessons Learned:
Through making this website, I've learned that something may be simple, but that doesn't mean you should rush through it. If you do, you might make careless mistakes, as I did. Apparently, the quotation marks in links are important ðŸ™„.
